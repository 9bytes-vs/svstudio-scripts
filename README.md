my experiments with synthesizer v studio scripting. _no promises that any of it works or isn't riddled with bugs_.

# Installation

>[!WARNING]
>Scripts are a feature of Synthesizer V Studio Pro, so *make sure you have the Pro editor before trying to use these!*

You can get to the 'scripts' folder by navigating to the menu bar and clicking "Open Scripts Folder".
